What to look for: |#|#|#|#|#|#|#| => ?, here look for occupied chairs being represented as a 1
and free chairs as a 0, these are in place of the # signs. Question mark represents number of 
occupied chairs at the time. Look for a count of the total number of given hair cuts. Look for
the salon full count which totals the number of times all chairs were occupied, and 
look for salon empty count which totals the number of times the stylist was able to sleep. After 
all haircuts are completed (120 in our case), "Done." will be printed.
